# üåü AB-System üåü

## üöÄ Overview

The **AB-System (Achievement/Badge System)** is a lightweight, customizable framework designed to integrate gamification into any application. It provides the core logic for defining achievements, tracking user progress based on in-app events, and awarding tiered badges.

This project is inspired by the structured achievement-badge systems seen across various platforms, re-imagined and re-implemented for a modern, flexible environment.

* **Custom Event Hooks:** Simple, API-driven tracking of user actions (events) to automatically calculate achievement progress.
* **[Add Your Core Technology]:** Built using [e.g., Python, JavaScript/Node.js, PHP] for **[e.g., fast performance, simple integration]**.
* **Scalable Structure:** Designed with clear separation of concerns, making it easy to extend and maintain the achievement logic.
* **[Add one more specific feature unique to your version]**

## üíª Usage

### 1. Defining New Achievements
Achievements are structured as rules. You define an event name and the required quantities for each tier.

**Example of an Achievement Definition (e.g., `QUICKDRAW`):**
```json
{
  "id": "QUICKDRAW",
  "name": "Quickdraw",
  "description": "Close an issue or pull request within 5 minutes of opening.",
  "tiers": [
    {"level": "DEFAULT", "value": 1},
    {"level": "BRONZE", "value": 5},
    // ... and so on
  ]
}
```

### 2. Tracking Events in Your Application
To trigger an achievement check, call the main tracking function from your application code:
```javascript
// Example in Node.js/JavaScript
import { trackEvent } from 'ab-system';

// The user successfully closed an issue quickly
trackEvent(userId, "QUICKDRAW", 1);
```

### 3. Retrieving a User's Badges
```python
# Example in Python
from ab_system import get_user_badges

user_badges = get_user_badges(user_id)
for badge in user_badges:
    print(f"User {user_id} earned: {badge.name} ({badge.tier} Tier)")
```
